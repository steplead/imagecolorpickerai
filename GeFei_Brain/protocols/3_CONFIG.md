# Protocol 3: Technical Configuration (The Setup)

> **Core Rule:** "Don't confuse the Crawler."

## 1. TDK (Title, Description, Keywords)
*   **Title Tag:** `[Main Keyword] - [USP/Benefit] | [Brand]`
    *   *Rule:* Keyword MUST be leftmost.
*   **Description:** Focus on **CTR** (Click Through Rate). "Free, No Sign-up, Fast."
*   **Keywords Meta:** **DELETE IT.** It is a spam signal.

## 2. Canonical Tags (Mandatory)
Every single page must have:
`<link rel="canonical" href="https://mysite.com/current-page" />`
*   *Reason:* Prevents `?sort=price` or `?ref=twitter` from creating "Duplicate Content" penalties.

## 3. AdSense Configuration
*   **Placement:** Top of Fold (but don't block content).
*   **RPM Goal:** Aim for **$10+** (Tier 1 Countries).
*   **Traffic Goal:** 1,000 visits/day is the "Safety Line" for consistent income.

## 4. Performance
*   **Images:** WebP format only.
*   **Speed:** Google Core Web Vitals (LCP < 2.5s).
