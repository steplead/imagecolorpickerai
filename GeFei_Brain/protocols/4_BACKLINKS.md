# Protocol 4: Link Building (The "Copy Homework" Strategy)

> **Core Rule:** "Don't invent. Just Copy." (抄作业)

## 1. The Strategy: Competitor Replication
Do not guess where to post links. Let your successful competitors tell you.
*   **Step 1:** Identify a top competitor (e.g., `play2048.co`).
*   **Step 2:** Plug them into **Ahrefs Backlink Checker** (Free or Paid).
*   **Step 3:** Filter for "Dofollow" and "DR > 30".
*   **Step 4:** Go to those exact websites and replicate the link.
    *   *If they posted on Hacker News -> You post on Hacker News.*
    *   *If they are in an AI Directory -> You submit to that Directory.*

## 2. Low-Hanging Fruit (The "Must-Haves")
For a new site, secure these accessible links first:
*   **Product Hunt:** Launch your tool.
*   **Hacker News:** Submit your "Show HN" post.
*   **Reddit:** Find relevant subreddits (r/SideProject, r/InternetIsBeautiful).
*   **AI Directories:** Submit to "Futurepedia", "There's An AI For That", etc.
    *   *Note:* Many paid directories are worth the $10-$20 investment for the permanent DR boost.

## 3. "Friendly Links" (Exchange)
*   **Strategy:** Find other "Indie Hacker" sites in similar (but not competing) niches.
*   **Action:** Email them: "I have a DR 15 site in the AI niche. Want to swap footer links?"
*   *Value:* Highly relevant context signals to Google.

## 4. Buying Links (The Gray Zone)
*   **Opinion:** Generally discouraged for "White Hat" longevity, BUT...
*   **Exception:** High-quality "Guest Posts" or "Sponsorships" on real, active blogs can be effective.
*   **Rule:** **Never** buy "Fiverr 1000 Backlinks" packages. That is suicide.

## 5. Automation (The "Safe" Way)
*   **Tool:** **AIPex** (Chrome Extension).
*   **Purpose:** Automating "Directory Submissions" (Navigation Sites).
*   **Method:**
    1.  Define your persona (Site Name, Description, URL).
    2.  Open a Directory submission page (e.g., from a list of "Google Login" supported sites).
    3.  Let AIPex auto-fill the form using your defined token.
*   **Safety Rule:** Only use automation that *simulates a human browser* (like AIPex). Avoid headless scripts that spam 1000 sites in a minute.

## 6. Frequency
*   **New Site:** Slow and steady. 1-2 quality links per week.
*   **Spike Warning:** Gaining 500 links in one day looks unnatural and triggers penalties.
