# 🔌 How to Install "GeFei Brain"

This folder is a **Portable Knowledge Module**.
You can use it in any Antigravity Project Window.

### Option A: The "Physical" Copy (Recommended)
1.  **Copy** this entire `GeFei_Brain` folder.
2.  **Paste** it into the root of your new project (e.g., `MyNewSite/`).
3.  **Tell Antigravity:**
    > "I have added the GeFei_Brain folder. Please read `GeFei_Brain/protocols/1_KEYWORDS.md` and help me find keywords for this new site."

### Option B: The "Reference" Mode
1.  Keep this folder in a central place (e.g., `~/Documents/GeFei_Brain/`).
2.  In your new project window, simply tell Antigravity the path:
    > "My SEO Knowledge Base is located at `/Users/bruno2025/Documents/iProjects/crawler/GeFei_Brain`. Please read the protocols there."

### ⚠️ Important
*   **Do not edit** the files inside `protocols/` unless you want to change the rules for *that specific project*.
*   **Run Maintenance:** Occasionally script `node scripts/maintenance.js` (if you have new scrape data) to see if rules need updating.
